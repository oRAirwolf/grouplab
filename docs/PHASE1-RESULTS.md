## M0. The marker module sweep

`docs/FIDUCIAL-DECISION.md` section 10, measurement 2: the same target printed at 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8 mm modules, to find the dot-gain floor on the actual printer. The sheets are generated and checked here; the measurement needs paper, and is next weekend's.

**Reproduce:** `python -B tools/layout/module_sweep.py`, then `grouplab sweep module tools/layout/layouts.json scans/phase1/module-sweep/layouts.json scans/phase1/module-sweep`. Everything is in `scans/phase1/module-sweep/`, with a README.

**For the paper protocol: five Letter pages**, one per sheet, printed at 100 percent on the Phase 0 printer and paper. No renderer change and no schema change was needed.

**The marker sizes are 24, 32, 40, 48 and 64 dmm, not the 30, 40, 50, 60 and 80 the brief and notes entry 12 give.** `tag36h11` prints as 8 modules across, a 6 by 6 data field inside a one-module black border, and TARGET-SCHEMA.md section 3.7 defines `markerSize` as the edge of that square, excluding the quiet zone. The renderer draws a module as `markerSize / 8` (`Tag36h11.Modules`), and FIDUCIAL-DECISION.md's own printed size is a 0.5 mm module in a 4.0 mm marker. "Ten modules across" counts the white ring, which the schema calls quiet zone. At 30, 40, 50, 60 and 80 dmm the modules would be 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75 and 1.0 mm, not the five measurement 2 names, and the renderer refuses 30 and 50 outright, because a 3.75 or 6.25 dmm module is not a whole half-dmm. The measurement's module sizes decide the sheets, and any protocol text quoting marker sizes should quote these.

**The 0.5 mm sheet is the Phase 0 sheet.** Its identifier is `GL-YCSK-DZZ1-R0VJ-4T5Y`, the built-in `GL-CF25-LTR` as printed for Phase 0, because an identifier hashes the geometry and not the name. So the sweep carries its own control, and the Phase 0 scans of sheets 1 to 3 are a second 0.5 mm point from an earlier print session.

**The marker count is not constant across the sweep, and the measurement has to allow for it.** The derivation merges lattice rows closer than the footprint plus 20 dmm, and drops a position whose footprint does not clear the bulls, codes and page edge, so both steps depend on the marker size: 44 markers at 0.3 and 0.4 mm, 34 at 0.5 mm and above. The two small-module sheets keep all 34 positions of the others and add ten: six in a row at y = 2325 dmm, which a footprint of 60 dmm or more merges into the row above, and four below the sighters at y = 2705 dmm. That second row is why those two sheets pass test 26f and the other three do not. Measurement 1 showed the worst bull still improving above 16 markers, so a raw comparison would credit the small modules with their extra markers. When the scans exist, register every sheet from the 34 lattice positions all five share as well as from all its markers; that needs no change to the sheets.

**The validator says nothing about the 0.3 mm module.** TARGET-SCHEMA.md section 7 says the format enforces the fiducial decision's module floor "through `markerSize` validation against `family`". No such rule exists in the validator or in section 10's conformance tests; the only limit is the JSON schema's `minimum` of 20 dmm. It is reported here rather than added, as the brief asks. The three test 26f warnings on the 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8 mm sheets are the sighter geometry as printed, the finding of `docs/PHASE0-RESULTS.md` section 4.4.

**Synthetic rendering is not the limit at any module.** Conformance test 43 passes on all five sheets at 300 and 600 DPI, worst bull 0.00026 in, with the shipped detector. The shipped canonical cell of at least 8 pixels reads a 3.5 px module at 300 DPI. Whatever the printed sweep shows is the printer's dot gain, which is what the measurement is for.

## M1. The developable surface fit

**Reproduce:** `grouplab surface synthetic` and `grouplab surface rendered` for the synthetic truth, then `grouplab surface frames` for the real frames. Raw rows: `scans/phase1/measurements/surface-synthetic.json` and `surface-rendered.json`, and `scans/phase0/measurements/surface.json`.

### M1.1 The model

A generalised cylinder, brief section 3.1, in `src/GroupLab.Core/Registration/`.

- **The sheet.** Rulings at an angle in page coordinates. The cross-section is integrated from a tangent angle that is a cubic in arc length across the rulings, so the map from page to sheet is an isometry by construction, and a flat sheet is all zeros. Distance along a straight page line is preserved to 0.0001 dmm on a strongly bent test sheet (`DevelopableSurfaceTests`).
- **The camera.** Rotation, translation, a focal length, and the Phase 0 lens, `u' = u (1 + k1 r^2 + k2 r^4)`. The focal length starts from the brief's EXIF estimate, the 35 mm equivalent over 36 mm times the long side, and is refined. Frames the EXIF says share a lens, focal length and f-number, are fitted jointly with one focal length and one lens. A scan, which has no focal length, is fitted orthographically.
- **The mapping.** `SurfaceMapping` implements the same page mapping the Phase 0 pipeline uses, so detection and the edge-fit bull locator run through it unchanged, and `grouplab measure --model surface` uses it.
- **The fit.** Levenberg-Marquardt on image-space corner residuals, from the Phase 0 lens fit's plane, at six starting ruling angles, because the ruling angle is undefined until the sheet bends. Every corner is then reclassified, at 12.7 dmm and then at the Phase 0 inlier distance of 2.54 dmm, with a refit after each.
- **Selection.** The bend is kept only when an F test says the corners support it; the next section says why.

### M1.2 Synthetic truth, and where it breaks

**Truth:** a 3000 by 4000 frame, focal length 2600 px against the EXIF start of 2556, k1 -0.05 and k2 +0.065 as the flat frames fitted, 260 mm from the page centre, so about a pixel per dmm as `main_flat1` is, tilted 8 degrees. **Corner noise** is 0.52 px per axis: `main_flat1`'s 0.00270 in RMS over 136 corners, at its scale. Ten seeds per cell, plus a noise-free trial on the bend axes, which recovers every bull to under 0.00001 in at every bend. The whole-sheet lens model is the Phase 0 photograph registration on the same corners.

| Axis, away from a 0.25 in bow | Passes the gate, median and 90th percentile, up to | First failure | Whole-sheet lens model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bow, rulings vertical | **2.00 in**, worst bull 0.00218 / 0.00234 in | not reached | 0.01377 in at a 0.05 in bow, 0.448 in at 2.00 |
| Curl, forward at the free bottom edge | **1.50 in**, 0.00127 / 0.00195 | 2.00 in: 90th percentile 0.00605 | 0.01129 at 0.05 in |
| Twist the model cannot represent | **0.10 in**, 0.00179 / 0.00265 | 0.25 in: 90th percentile 0.00607; 0.50 in fails outright, 0.01365 median | 0.072 to 0.108 |
| Marker count | **the 23 `main_flat3` decoded**, 0.00227 / 0.00356 | 23 at random: 90th percentile 0.00692; 16 or fewer fail | 0.100 at the 23 of `main_flat3` |
| Keystone | **0.70**, the harshest tried, 0.00133 / 0.00159 | not reached | 0.040 to 0.056 |
| Starting focal length | **0.55 to 1.80 times truth**, refined to within 1.4 percent | not reached | |

**The model survives any bend a mounted sheet plausibly makes, and a keystone harsher than any real frame.** What breaks it is a twist of a quarter inch or more, which no generalised cylinder can take, and losing markers from where the bend is. `main_flat3`'s own 23 markers are enough because they are spread across the sheet; 23 at random are not, because a random 23 can leave a region unconstrained.

**Rendered, through detection and the edge-fit locator** (`grouplab surface rendered`), after the two changes below:

| Case | Whole-sheet lens model: worst scoring / sighter (in) | Surface: corners kept, fitted deflection, worst scoring / sighter (in) |
|---|---|---|
| Flat | 0.00055 / 0.00050, pass | 136 of 136, 0.013 in, 0.00045 / 0.00210, pass |
| Bow 0.25 in | 0.03338 / 0.02981, fail | 136 of 136, 0.251 in, 0.00034 / 0.00052, pass |
| Bow 1.00 in | 0.08262 / 0.11029, fail | 136 of 136, 1.000 in, 0.00040 / 0.00016, pass |
| Bow 0.25 in at keystone 0.802 | 0.04420 / 0.04280, fail | 136 of 136, 0.251 in, 0.00034 / 0.00051, pass |
| Bow 0.25 in with a 0.10 in twist | 0.03596 / 0.04605, fail | 136 of 136, 0.348 in, 0.00095 / 0.00150, pass |

### M1.3 Two changes, both made on synthetic evidence before any real frame

1. **Every corner is reclassified, at 12.7 dmm before 2.54.** The first version reclassified only at 2.54 dmm, after fitting the corners the planar RANSAC had kept. On the rendered 1.00 in bow that RANSAC rejected the outer marker columns, the bend fitted to the rest missed them by 4 to 5 dmm, and the fit kept 96 of 136 corners, fitted 1.035 in, and failed at 0.00555 in. Reclassifying at the misread distance first gives the columns back: 136 of 136, 1.000 in, 0.00040 in.
2. **The bend is kept only when it earns its parameters.** Always fitting the bend doubled a flat sheet's worst bull under noise, 0.00217 in median and 0.00470 at the 90th percentile against the lens model's 0.00108, with the extrapolated sighters taking most of it, which brief section 3.4 forbids. `SurfaceSelection` compares the page-space residual of the surface fit with the planar model refitted to the same corners, by an F test at p = 0.001 on the surface's four extra parameters. On the sweep it chose the plane for 10 of 10 noisy flat sheets, 0.00108 / 0.00122 in, and the bend for every bent sheet at every level, from 0.05 in. The rendered table above is the surface fit alone, which is why its flat row still shows the sighter at 0.00210 in.

### M1.4 The first real-frame run crashed, and was not retried

`grouplab surface frames` was first run once in the foreground on 14 September 2026 per `docs/NOTES-FROM-PLANNING.md` entry 14, with the surface fit of `d78c17c` plus two changes that do not alter what is computed: a tabulated profile and cached rotation in `SurfaceMapping`, held to 1e-6 px of the direct geometry by `DevelopableSurfaceTests`, and the frames prepared and evaluated in parallel. **It crashed after 60 seconds and wrote no raw rows.** Per entry 14 it was not retried and the frame set was not reduced.

```
System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.

```

It threw on `20260913_130543`, `130550` and `130554`, sheet 1 lying loose on a table, fitted jointly with `ultrawide1-3` as the 2.20 mm f/2.2 lens. `Crossing` averages three samples at each end of a radial edge profile, and the surface mappings of those frames put fewer than three across an edge. Entry 15 answered it: those frames are `photographGate: none`, every gated frame had finished, and the order is a guard, a seeding fix, a re-run and this report. The eleven frames that had finished are reproduced to every printed digit by the run below, so their partial lines are not repeated.

### M1.5 The real-frame run

`grouplab surface frames`, run in the foreground on 14 September 2026 after the two changes of entry 15 section 3: **all 14 photographs and all 10 gated scans complete in 1.3 minutes**, raw rows in `scans/phase0/measurements/surface.json`.

**The two changes.**

1. **The edge-fit locator has no input that throws.** A profile of fewer than 3 or more than 4096 samples, a mapping with no finite scale at the bull, or a centre fit that diverges now fails that bull with the reason in its `failure` field and the trace, and the sheet carries on. `EdgeFitGuardTests` breaks a real render's mapping eight ways and requires a named failure every time.
2. **One starting focal length per joint fit, never one per frame, with a warning naming each frame whose EXIF disagrees.** The seven 2.2 mm frames carry two 35 mm equivalents, 13 mm on `ultrawide1-3` and 23 mm on the four table frames, so a median or a vote would decide by frame count. `SurfaceFit.SeedFocal` tries each distinct EXIF start on every frame fitted alone and keeps the one with the lower total residual.

**It was run twice.** The first run's warnings said the ultrawide frames "fit best" from 2556 px, which the costs do not support, so the text was made neutral and the command run again. The two sets of raw rows are identical apart from those three warnings.

**The seeding change did not matter, and neither the start nor the seeding caused the crash.** The two candidate starts cost 1.955E+4 and 1.957E+4 px^2, 0.1 percent apart. `ultrawide1-3` start from 2556 px in this run and started from 1444 px in the crashed one, and every figure they print is the same to five digits. The three table frames started from 2556 px both times and are degenerate both times.

Surface fit per photograph. Focal lengths in pixels: the EXIF starting estimate, the frame fitted alone, and shared across the frames of its lens. Inches.

#### The mounted gate fails on all seven frames, under every approach

**No mounted frame comes inside 0.005 in, whichever model registers it.** The surface's worst scoring bull is 0.01177 in at best (`main1`) and 0.09183 at worst (`ultrawide2`). The generalised cylinder does not make a sheet hanging from one pin measurable.

**It is better than the Phase 0 registration, but not enough.**

- **Worst scoring bull:** better on five frames and worse on two, `ultrawide2` (0.09183 against 0.06983 in) and `main2` (0.05971 against 0.04350).
- **Worst sighter:** better on all seven. On `main3` it goes from 0.11379 to 0.00508 in, and on `main1` from 0.04841 to 0.00620.
- **Scoring bulls over the gate:** fewer on five frames, the same on `main1`, and more on `ultrawide1`, 18 against 13.

**A plane through the six markers nearest each bull beats the cylinder on six of the seven frames.** Only `telephoto2` goes the other way, 0.03626 against 0.02241 in. A local model absorbing error that a whole-sheet cylinder leaves says the cylinder's form is what limits it, not the corners it was given.

**The corners say the same.**

- **Residual:** over the corners the surface keeps it is 0.00439 to 0.00622 in on the mounted frames, against 0.00296 to 0.00432 on the flat ones.
- **Corners rejected:** 9 to 47 percent on the mounted frames (the ultrawide frames keep 56, 57 and 71 percent), where every rendered bow in M1.2 kept 136 of 136.

Which misfit is responsible, the lens absorbing the bend or a twist the cylinder cannot represent, is entry 15 section 4's question and is measured next, not here.

#### The flat control held

The F test declined the bend on all three flat frames. The selected model returns the Phase 0 figures on `main_flat1` and `main_flat2`, 0.00343 and 0.00566 in, and 0.01108 on `main_flat3` against Phase 0's 0.01183, because there the plane is refitted to the 89 corners the surface kept rather than Phase 0's 91. The surface alone would have made all three worse, 0.00443, 0.01780 and 0.02581 in, which is what M1.3's selection exists to stop. The flat gate verdicts are Phase 0's, three fails, for the reasons `docs/PHASE0-RESULTS.md` section 8 gives.

#### The paper gate passes ten of ten through the selected model

Worst bull 0.00319 in, on tile 3, and every selected figure is within 0.00026 in of the homography's. The surface alone fails all four 300 yard tiles: 36 corners for ten parameters, fitted as 1.8 to 2.6 in of deflection on a flat scan and extrapolated to 0.018 to 0.034 in, and the F test declines it every time. **It also kept the bend once on a flat scan**, `gl-cf25-ltr-d-filled`, F 11.2 against 6.91, a false positive at a nominal p = 0.001. That costs nothing here, 0.00290 against the homography's 0.00247 in. It shows a scan's corner errors are not the independent Gaussian errors the test assumes, so its nominal level is optimistic.

#### The table frames, and what the sheet says about its EXIF

`20260913_130559` fits. The bend is declined and the selected model is within the gate on every scoring bull, failing on a sighter at 0.00947 in. The other three complete without an exception, but degenerate: the joint fit keeps 8, 4 and 0 of 136 corners and fits 0.73 to 2.16 in of deflection to a sheet lying on a table. Bulls fail with named reasons, such as "the mapping gives the 127 dmm edge a profile of 2 samples at 31.322 dmm per pixel", and the rest are located through a mapping that is wrong.

**The sheet does check its own EXIF, and on these frames it contradicts the reading that the 35 mm tag is the wrong one.**

- **Main and telephoto:** a lens whose tags agree fits within a few percent of its EXIF estimate. The main camera's shared focal length is 2725 px against 2556 (+6.6 percent), and the telephoto's 7924 against 7667 (+3.4 percent).
- **Ultrawide:** fitted alone, `ultrawide1-3` recover 1621 to 1940 px against their 13 mm tag's 1444.
- **Table frames:** fitted alone, three of the four recover 2353, 2366 and 2771 px, near their 23 mm tag's 2556 and far from the ultrawide's figures. The fourth, `130559`, recovers 906 px, a frame whose flat, nearly frontal sheet constrains its focal length least.

If the 23 mm tag were wrong and these were ultrawide pixels, they would fit near the ultrawide. Forcing the ultrawide's shared 1659 px onto them is what degenerates them.

**One explanation fits all three tags being true.** The phone took the close-up table frames on the ultrawide sensor and cropped them to the main camera's field of view. The physical focal length and f-number are then the ultrawide's, the 35 mm equivalent describes the pixels, and a joint fit keyed on focal length and f-number mixes two pixel geometries. Their distortion differs too, since a crop rescales the normalised radius. That is not established from these frames. What is established is that the lens key entry 6 chose puts frames with different pixel focal lengths into one fit. The key is a planning decision, so it is reported and not changed. The shared 2.2 mm lens, k1 -0.031 and k2 +0.022, therefore includes the table frames and is not the ultrawide's lens.

#### Two defects the run exposed, not fixed

1. **`SurfaceSelection` keeps the bend by default when it cannot fit a plane.** With fewer than eight corners kept it returns "prefer surface" with no F, which is why `130550` and `130554` print "bend kept" at 4 and 0 corners. A surface fit that keeps fewer corners than it has parameters should fail the frame with a reason.
2. **Nothing fails a frame whose surface fit rejects nearly every corner.** The three degenerate table frames produce bull figures instead of a frame failure.

Both touch only the ungated table frames in this run, and neither changes a gated figure.

### M1.6 What M1 means for the paper protocol

**Do not plan on the surface fit to pass photographs of a sheet hanging from one pin.** None of seven passes, the best is 2.4 times the gate, and a local plane beats the whole-sheet cylinder on six of them.

**What measures today is a sheet held flat.** Through the selected model a flat photograph reproduces Phase 0 and a scan passes ten of ten. Any photograph the protocol means to gate should have the sheet held flat, not hanging.

**If mounted frames are wanted for entry 15 section 4**, the numbers suggest four things for planning to weigh:

- one camera per set, at one zoom setting;
- shot from far enough that the phone keeps that camera, with the camera recorded;
- the sheet fixed at all four corners in at least some frames, so bend without twist is in the set;
- every marker in frame.

The mounted frames lost the most accuracy where they lost the most corners.

## Decision log

One line per method choice where there was a real alternative: what was rejected, and why.

- **M0: `markerSize` is 8 modules, over the brief's 10.** TARGET-SCHEMA.md section 3.7, the renderer and FIDUCIAL-DECISION.md all put 8 modules in `markerSize`; 10 would print the wrong modules and two of the five sheets would not render.
- **M0: quiet zone of two modules, over a fixed 10 dmm.** It keeps each marker in the proportion FIDUCIAL-DECISION.md settled at 0.5 mm, so only the module scale changes.
- **M0: `GL-CF25-LTR` as printed, over the 454 dmm sighter gap of the pending geometry change.** The 0.5 mm sheet is then the Phase 0 sheet by identifier, which makes it the sweep's control; the sighter geometry does not bear on the module floor.
- **M0: each sheet's lattice derived at its own footprint, over forcing the 0.5 mm lattice onto all five.** The derivation rule is the format's, and an explicit lattice would be a different fiducial scheme; the count difference is handled at measurement by registering from the shared positions.
- **M0: a footprint parameter in `tools/layout/layout.py`, over a C#-only generator.** CONTRIBUTING.md makes the layout tool the authority; the C# derivation is checked against it marker for marker, and `layouts.json` is byte-identical with the parameter at its default.
- **M0: sheets named by module, frozen by identifier once printed.** Names a person can match to a printout while the set is live, and the entry 11 rule when it becomes a measurement input.
- **M1: the cross-section as a tangent angle integrated along arc length, over a height function of page position.** Integration makes the page-to-sheet map an isometry by construction; a height function stretches the sheet wherever it slopes.
- **M1: a cubic tangent angle, three coefficients, over five.** The brief's lower bound; noise-free recovery is exact at every bend swept, and each extra coefficient is more bend for noise to fit.
- **M1: corner residuals in image pixels, over page dmm.** A detector's corner error is a pixel quantity; reclassification and selection stay in page dmm so the Phase 0 distances mean what they meant.
- **M1: six starting ruling angles, over a single start.** The ruling angle has no gradient until the sheet bends, so one start can settle on the wrong family.
- **M1: focal length refined from the brief's EXIF estimate, over fixing it at the estimate.** Starts from 0.55 to 1.80 times truth all refine to within 1.4 percent; a fixed wrong focal length leaves the pose unable to reproduce even a flat sheet's homography.
- **M1: reclassify every corner at 12.7 then 2.54 dmm, over 2.54 only.** The rendered 1.00 in bow: 96 of 136 corners and a fail, against 136 and 0.00040 in.
- **M1: an F test at p = 0.001 for keeping the bend, over always fitting it or a fixed residual threshold.** Always fitting doubled a flat sheet's worst bull; a residual threshold would depend on scale and marker count, which an F test does not.
- **M1: synthetic corner noise from `main_flat1`'s residual, 0.52 px per axis, over the 0.16 px a clean render gives.** The render's figure would flatter the model; the flat frame's includes whatever its flat model left, so it is a ceiling.
- **M1: a forward-difference Jacobian, over analytic derivatives.** Fourteen parameters, and noise-free recovery to under 0.00001 in shows it is accurate enough.
- **M1: a bull whose edge profile has under 3 or over 4096 samples fails with a reason, over clamping the sample count.** A clamped count would still sample a mapping already known to be degenerate and report a centre from it.
- **M1: one starting focal length per joint fit, the EXIF candidate with the lower alone-fit residual, over the group median or a vote.** Four of the seven 2.2 mm frames carry one 35 mm equivalent and three the other, so a median or vote decides by frame count. Measured on those frames the choice does not matter: the costs are 0.1 percent apart and the fitted results are identical from either start.
- **M1: the joint-fit lens key left as focal length and f-number, with the table frames reported rather than regrouped.** Entry 6 settled the key, and regrouping after seeing these frames degenerate would be fitting the method to them.
