## M0. The marker module sweep

`docs/FIDUCIAL-DECISION.md` section 10, measurement 2: the same target printed at 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8 mm modules, to find the dot-gain floor on the actual printer. The sheets are generated and checked here; the measurement needs paper, and is next weekend's.

**Reproduce:** `python -B tools/layout/module_sweep.py`, then `grouplab sweep module tools/layout/layouts.json scans/phase1/module-sweep/layouts.json scans/phase1/module-sweep`. Everything is in `scans/phase1/module-sweep/`, with a README.

| Module | Marker / quiet zone / footprint (dmm) | Markers | Lattice matches `layout.py` | Identifier | Validator | Test 43 worst bull, 300 / 600 DPI (in) | PDF pages |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.3 mm | 24 / 6 / 36 | 44 | yes | `GL-DFA3-H72S-8KKS-A00S` | clean | 0.00016 / 0.00003 | 1 |
| 0.4 mm | 32 / 8 / 48 | 44 | yes | `GL-78H9-DKWN-AHDV-4WAK` | clean | 0.00017 / 0.00008 | 1 |
| 0.5 mm | 40 / 10 / 60 | 34 | yes | `GL-YCSK-DZZ1-R0VJ-4T5Y` | 3 warnings, test 26f | 0.00026 / 0.00012 | 1 |
| 0.6 mm | 48 / 12 / 72 | 34 | yes | `GL-683J-3ZR8-60D5-0FGG` | 3 warnings, test 26f | 0.00012 / 0.00004 | 1 |
| 0.8 mm | 64 / 16 / 96 | 34 | yes | `GL-SEBE-5F06-GVTF-3CZK` | 3 warnings, test 26f | 0.00007 / 0.00015 | 1 |

**For the paper protocol: five Letter pages**, one per sheet, printed at 100 percent on the Phase 0 printer and paper. No renderer change and no schema change was needed.

**The marker sizes are 24, 32, 40, 48 and 64 dmm, not the 30, 40, 50, 60 and 80 the brief and notes entry 12 give.** `tag36h11` prints as 8 modules across, a 6 by 6 data field inside a one-module black border, and TARGET-SCHEMA.md section 3.7 defines `markerSize` as the edge of that square, excluding the quiet zone. The renderer draws a module as `markerSize / 8` (`Tag36h11.Modules`), and FIDUCIAL-DECISION.md's own printed size is a 0.5 mm module in a 4.0 mm marker. "Ten modules across" counts the white ring, which the schema calls quiet zone. At 30, 40, 50, 60 and 80 dmm the modules would be 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75 and 1.0 mm, not the five measurement 2 names, and the renderer refuses 30 and 50 outright, because a 3.75 or 6.25 dmm module is not a whole half-dmm. The measurement's module sizes decide the sheets, and any protocol text quoting marker sizes should quote these.

**The 0.5 mm sheet is the Phase 0 sheet.** Its identifier is `GL-YCSK-DZZ1-R0VJ-4T5Y`, the built-in `GL-CF25-LTR` as printed for Phase 0, because an identifier hashes the geometry and not the name. So the sweep carries its own control, and the Phase 0 scans of sheets 1 to 3 are a second 0.5 mm point from an earlier print session.

**The marker count is not constant across the sweep, and the measurement has to allow for it.** The derivation merges lattice rows closer than the footprint plus 20 dmm, and drops a position whose footprint does not clear the bulls, codes and page edge, so both steps depend on the marker size: 44 markers at 0.3 and 0.4 mm, 34 at 0.5 mm and above. The two small-module sheets keep all 34 positions of the others and add ten: six in a row at y = 2325 dmm, which a footprint of 60 dmm or more merges into the row above, and four below the sighters at y = 2705 dmm. That second row is why those two sheets pass test 26f and the other three do not. Measurement 1 showed the worst bull still improving above 16 markers, so a raw comparison would credit the small modules with their extra markers. When the scans exist, register every sheet from the 34 lattice positions all five share as well as from all its markers; that needs no change to the sheets.

**The validator says nothing about the 0.3 mm module.** TARGET-SCHEMA.md section 7 says the format enforces the fiducial decision's module floor "through `markerSize` validation against `family`". No such rule exists in the validator or in section 10's conformance tests; the only limit is the JSON schema's `minimum` of 20 dmm. It is reported here rather than added, as the brief asks. The three test 26f warnings on the 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8 mm sheets are the sighter geometry as printed, the finding of `docs/PHASE0-RESULTS.md` section 4.4.

**Synthetic rendering is not the limit at any module.** Conformance test 43 passes on all five sheets at 300 and 600 DPI, worst bull 0.00026 in, with the shipped detector. The shipped canonical cell of at least 8 pixels reads a 3.5 px module at 300 DPI. Whatever the printed sweep shows is the printer's dot gain, which is what the measurement is for.

## M1. The developable surface fit

**Reproduce:** `grouplab surface synthetic` and `grouplab surface rendered` for the synthetic truth, then `grouplab surface frames` for the real frames. Raw rows: `scans/phase1/measurements/surface-synthetic.json` and `surface-rendered.json`, and `scans/phase0/measurements/surface.json`.

### M1.1 The model

A generalised cylinder, brief section 3.1, in `src/GroupLab.Core/Registration/`.

- **The sheet.** Rulings at an angle in page coordinates. The cross-section is integrated from a tangent angle that is a cubic in arc length across the rulings, so the map from page to sheet is an isometry by construction, and a flat sheet is all zeros. Distance along a straight page line is preserved to 0.0001 dmm on a strongly bent test sheet (`DevelopableSurfaceTests`).
- **The camera.** Rotation, translation, a focal length, and the Phase 0 lens, `u' = u (1 + k1 r^2 + k2 r^4)`. The focal length starts from the brief's EXIF estimate, the 35 mm equivalent over 36 mm times the long side, and is refined. Frames the EXIF says share a lens, focal length and f-number, are fitted jointly with one focal length and one lens. A scan, which has no focal length, is fitted orthographically.
- **The mapping.** `SurfaceMapping` implements the same page mapping the Phase 0 pipeline uses, so detection and the edge-fit bull locator run through it unchanged, and `grouplab measure --model surface` uses it.
- **The fit.** Levenberg-Marquardt on image-space corner residuals, from the Phase 0 lens fit's plane, at six starting ruling angles, because the ruling angle is undefined until the sheet bends. Every corner is then reclassified, at 12.7 dmm and then at the Phase 0 inlier distance of 2.54 dmm, with a refit after each.
- **Selection.** The bend is kept only when an F test says the corners support it; the next section says why.

### M1.2 Synthetic truth, and where it breaks

**Truth:** a 3000 by 4000 frame, focal length 2600 px against the EXIF start of 2556, k1 -0.05 and k2 +0.065 as the flat frames fitted, 260 mm from the page centre, so about a pixel per dmm as `main_flat1` is, tilted 8 degrees. **Corner noise** is 0.52 px per axis: `main_flat1`'s 0.00270 in RMS over 136 corners, at its scale. Ten seeds per cell, plus a noise-free trial on the bend axes, which recovers every bull to under 0.00001 in at every bend. The whole-sheet lens model is the Phase 0 photograph registration on the same corners.

| Axis, away from a 0.25 in bow | Passes the gate, median and 90th percentile, up to | First failure | Whole-sheet lens model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bow, rulings vertical | **2.00 in**, worst bull 0.00218 / 0.00234 in | not reached | 0.01377 in at a 0.05 in bow, 0.448 in at 2.00 |
| Curl, forward at the free bottom edge | **1.50 in**, 0.00127 / 0.00195 | 2.00 in: 90th percentile 0.00605 | 0.01129 at 0.05 in |
| Twist the model cannot represent | **0.10 in**, 0.00179 / 0.00265 | 0.25 in: 90th percentile 0.00607; 0.50 in fails outright, 0.01365 median | 0.072 to 0.108 |
| Marker count | **the 23 `main_flat3` decoded**, 0.00227 / 0.00356 | 23 at random: 90th percentile 0.00692; 16 or fewer fail | 0.100 at the 23 of `main_flat3` |
| Keystone | **0.70**, the harshest tried, 0.00133 / 0.00159 | not reached | 0.040 to 0.056 |
| Starting focal length | **0.55 to 1.80 times truth**, refined to within 1.4 percent | not reached | |

**The model survives any bend a mounted sheet plausibly makes, and a keystone harsher than any real frame.** What breaks it is a twist of a quarter inch or more, which no generalised cylinder can take, and losing markers from where the bend is. `main_flat3`'s own 23 markers are enough because they are spread across the sheet; 23 at random are not, because a random 23 can leave a region unconstrained.

**Rendered, through detection and the edge-fit locator** (`grouplab surface rendered`), after the two changes below:

| Case | Whole-sheet lens model: worst scoring / sighter (in) | Surface: corners kept, fitted deflection, worst scoring / sighter (in) |
|---|---|---|
| Flat | 0.00055 / 0.00050, pass | 136 of 136, 0.013 in, 0.00045 / 0.00210, pass |
| Bow 0.25 in | 0.03338 / 0.02981, fail | 136 of 136, 0.251 in, 0.00034 / 0.00052, pass |
| Bow 1.00 in | 0.08262 / 0.11029, fail | 136 of 136, 1.000 in, 0.00040 / 0.00016, pass |
| Bow 0.25 in at keystone 0.802 | 0.04420 / 0.04280, fail | 136 of 136, 0.251 in, 0.00034 / 0.00051, pass |
| Bow 0.25 in with a 0.10 in twist | 0.03596 / 0.04605, fail | 136 of 136, 0.348 in, 0.00095 / 0.00150, pass |

### M1.3 Two changes, both made on synthetic evidence before any real frame

1. **Every corner is reclassified, at 12.7 dmm before 2.54.** The first version reclassified only at 2.54 dmm, after fitting the corners the planar RANSAC had kept. On the rendered 1.00 in bow that RANSAC rejected the outer marker columns, the bend fitted to the rest missed them by 4 to 5 dmm, and the fit kept 96 of 136 corners, fitted 1.035 in, and failed at 0.00555 in. Reclassifying at the misread distance first gives the columns back: 136 of 136, 1.000 in, 0.00040 in.
2. **The bend is kept only when it earns its parameters.** Always fitting the bend doubled a flat sheet's worst bull under noise, 0.00217 in median and 0.00470 at the 90th percentile against the lens model's 0.00108, with the extrapolated sighters taking most of it, which brief section 3.4 forbids. `SurfaceSelection` compares the page-space residual of the surface fit with the planar model refitted to the same corners, by an F test at p = 0.001 on the surface's four extra parameters. On the sweep it chose the plane for 10 of 10 noisy flat sheets, 0.00108 / 0.00122 in, and the bend for every bent sheet at every level, from 0.05 in. The rendered table above is the surface fit alone, which is why its flat row still shows the sighter at 0.00210 in.

### M1.4 The real-frame run failed, and was not retried

`grouplab surface frames`, run once in the foreground on 14 September 2026 per `docs/NOTES-FROM-PLANNING.md` entry 14, with the code of this commit: the surface fit of `d78c17c`, plus two changes that do not alter what is computed, a tabulated profile and cached rotation in `SurfaceMapping` (held to 1e-6 px of the direct geometry by `DevelopableSurfaceTests`) and the frames prepared and evaluated in parallel. **It crashed after 60 seconds and wrote no `scans/phase0/measurements/surface.json`.** Per entry 14 it was not retried, and the frame set was not reduced.

**The error**, three times, one per failing frame:

```
System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
   at GroupLab.Core.Measurement.EdgeFitBullLocator.Crossing(Double[] v, Int32 sign, Double contrast) in BullLocators.cs:line 311
   at GroupLab.Core.Measurement.EdgeFitBullLocator.Locate(...) in BullLocators.cs:line 246
   at GroupLab.Core.Measurement.SheetMeasurer.LocateBulls(...) in SheetMeasurer.cs:line 556
   at GroupLab.Cli.Spike.SurfaceFrames.Evaluate(Prepared p, SurfaceFrameResult fit) in SurfaceFrames.cs:line 255
```

**Which frames.** All 14 usable photographs were prepared and all three lenses fitted jointly. Eleven frames were then evaluated and printed their progress line; the three that did not, and threw, are `20260913_130543`, `20260913_130550` and `20260913_130554`, sheet 1 lying loose on a table, which were fitted jointly with `ultrawide1-3` as the 2.20 mm f/2.2 lens. The exception came from locating bulls through their surface mapping, so their surface fits completed and the mapping they produced is what failed.

**What the code says happened.** `Crossing` averages the first and last `max(3, n / 8)` samples of each radial profile, so it needs at least three. The sample count is `ceil(2 x half-width / step) + 1`, where `step` comes from the mapping's page-per-pixel Jacobian at the bull. For fewer than three samples the mapping must have put hundreds of times more page under a pixel than the frame shows, so **the surface fits of those three frames are degenerate at a bull.** Why is not established, and establishing it would mean running the frames again. One fact that may bear on it: those three frames carry a 35 mm equivalent tag of 23 against their lens's 13, the inconsistent tag entry 6 recorded, so their focal length started at 2556 px while `ultrawide1-3` started at 1444 px in the same joint fit. The synthetic sweep covered a start of 1.8 times truth on a single frame, not two starts disagreeing inside one joint fit.

**A second, separate fault.** `Crossing` has no guard for a profile shorter than three samples. No Phase 0 mapping ever produced one, so it never mattered; a degenerate mapping should be a failed bull with a reason, not an exception. It is not fixed here.

**The eleven frames that finished, as printed**, recorded because they are real-frame numbers and a stopped run should not hide what it showed. They are partial and have no raw rows, and are not the M1 report.

```

**Read with that caution, they say two things.** On the flat frames the F test declined the bend every time and the selected model returned the Phase 0 figures, 0.00343 and 0.00566 in on `main_flat1` and `main_flat2`, so the control held. On the seven pinned frames the bend was kept every time and the surface kept 66 to 120 corners where the whole-sheet model kept 25 to 90, but no frame came inside the gate: worst scoring bull 0.01177 to 0.09183 in, better than Phase 0's whole-sheet figure on five frames and worse on two, `ultrawide2` and `main2`. That is consistent with the twist a single-pin hang makes, which the sweep puts beyond the model from 0.25 in, but without the finished run and its raw rows it is not measured.

## Decision log

One line per method choice where there was a real alternative: what was rejected, and why.

- **M0: `markerSize` is 8 modules, over the brief's 10.** TARGET-SCHEMA.md section 3.7, the renderer and FIDUCIAL-DECISION.md all put 8 modules in `markerSize`; 10 would print the wrong modules and two of the five sheets would not render.
- **M0: quiet zone of two modules, over a fixed 10 dmm.** It keeps each marker in the proportion FIDUCIAL-DECISION.md settled at 0.5 mm, so only the module scale changes.
- **M0: `GL-CF25-LTR` as printed, over the 454 dmm sighter gap of the pending geometry change.** The 0.5 mm sheet is then the Phase 0 sheet by identifier, which makes it the sweep's control; the sighter geometry does not bear on the module floor.
- **M0: each sheet's lattice derived at its own footprint, over forcing the 0.5 mm lattice onto all five.** The derivation rule is the format's, and an explicit lattice would be a different fiducial scheme; the count difference is handled at measurement by registering from the shared positions.
- **M0: a footprint parameter in `tools/layout/layout.py`, over a C#-only generator.** CONTRIBUTING.md makes the layout tool the authority; the C# derivation is checked against it marker for marker, and `layouts.json` is byte-identical with the parameter at its default.
- **M0: sheets named by module, frozen by identifier once printed.** Names a person can match to a printout while the set is live, and the entry 11 rule when it becomes a measurement input.
- **M1: the cross-section as a tangent angle integrated along arc length, over a height function of page position.** Integration makes the page-to-sheet map an isometry by construction; a height function stretches the sheet wherever it slopes.
- **M1: a cubic tangent angle, three coefficients, over five.** The brief's lower bound; noise-free recovery is exact at every bend swept, and each extra coefficient is more bend for noise to fit.
- **M1: corner residuals in image pixels, over page dmm.** A detector's corner error is a pixel quantity; reclassification and selection stay in page dmm so the Phase 0 distances mean what they meant.
- **M1: six starting ruling angles, over a single start.** The ruling angle has no gradient until the sheet bends, so one start can settle on the wrong family.
- **M1: focal length refined from the brief's EXIF estimate, over fixing it at the estimate.** Starts from 0.55 to 1.80 times truth all refine to within 1.4 percent; a fixed wrong focal length leaves the pose unable to reproduce even a flat sheet's homography.
- **M1: reclassify every corner at 12.7 then 2.54 dmm, over 2.54 only.** The rendered 1.00 in bow: 96 of 136 corners and a fail, against 136 and 0.00040 in.
- **M1: an F test at p = 0.001 for keeping the bend, over always fitting it or a fixed residual threshold.** Always fitting doubled a flat sheet's worst bull; a residual threshold would depend on scale and marker count, which an F test does not.
- **M1: synthetic corner noise from `main_flat1`'s residual, 0.52 px per axis, over the 0.16 px a clean render gives.** The render's figure would flatter the model; the flat frame's includes whatever its flat model left, so it is a ceiling.
- **M1: a forward-difference Jacobian, over analytic derivatives.** Fourteen parameters, and noise-free recovery to under 0.00001 in shows it is accurate enough.
